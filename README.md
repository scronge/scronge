- 👋 Hi, I’m @scronge
- 👀 I’m interested in math, science, and tech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI & Stats at the PhD level while teaching some advanced math courses
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, math modeling and discrete math (graph theory, linear algebra, combinatorics)
- 📫 How to reach me at my email : name this animal https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRHF3g_LO85mPZVqkwZpJ7Z1bMQ_tYg-zvkatEXXYXHPSIYgqce , change the 'c' to a 'k', and then " 733 at G " 

Most of my code written has been academic, you can see a list of research projects here:

If you have more money than you know what to spend on, or would like to encourage a random soul to continue doing math you can do a [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/scronge/).
