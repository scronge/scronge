- 👋 Hi, I’m @scronge
- 👀 I’m interested in math, science, and tech
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI & Stats at the PhD level
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on machine learning, math modeling and discrete math (graph theory, linear algebra, combinatorics)

Most of my code written has been academic, you can see a list of research projects on my LinkedIn page

- 🔬 Research interests:
      - Mathematical Modeling in Biology
      - Graph Theory and Linear Algebra
      - Optimization
